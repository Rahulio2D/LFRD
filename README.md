# LFRD
LFRD (Pronounced Alfred) is a Lightweight Framework for Rapid Design for personal and commercial static websites.

## Installation

When installing LFRD for the first time, you will need to copy the template files to a root directory so they can be easily obtained at any time. This can be automated by running the `lfrd install .` command in the project directory.

## Building

Build the app by running `go install .`

## Add to PATH

Add the executable to your path by running `export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. This will allow you to run LFRD anywhere on your machine.
